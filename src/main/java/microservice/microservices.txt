First, to be precise, when talking about microservices, we are actually referring to a microservice architecture

This architecture type is a particular way of developing software, web or mobile applications as suites of independent services 
 – a.k.a microservices

These services are created to serve only one specific business function, such as: 
user management, user roles, e-commerce cart, search engine, social media logins, etc.

As per micorservice : "do one thing and do it perfect!"

Furthermore, they are independent of each other, meaning they can be written in different programming languages 
and use different data storages. the practically unlimited scalability


Aadvantages::
=======================================================
allow developers to build their applications from various independent components which can easily be 
changed, removed or upgraded without affecting the whole application – as is not the case with monoliths

reusability

Developers must be devops as they work on many things

decomposition by business capability / subdomain
