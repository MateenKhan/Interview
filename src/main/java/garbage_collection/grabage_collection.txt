There is a term that you should know before learning about GC. The term is "stop-the-world."
Stop-the-world means that the JVM is stopping the application from running to execute a GC.
When stop-the-world occurs, every thread except for the threads needed for the GC will stop their tasks.
The interrupted tasks will resume only after the GC task has completed. GC tuning often means reducing this stop-the-world time.

Garbage collection (gc) is called in java to clean up resources in java
gc is a demon thread
Heap memory of unreachable objects is emtyied by gc
any instance that is not reachable by live thread can be gc 
gc works even with objects that are in island of isolation (ios)
ios: if a1 is one object and a2 is another object 
	if a1= a2;
	and no object is reference either a1 or a2 then
	both a1 and a2 are in island of isolation and can be gc.
